# iExpense

In this project we’re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you’re going to need to learn how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
- Delete rows from a list
- Save and load user data
…and more.

# Day 38 – Challenge

- Use the user's preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.
- Modify the ContentView expense amounts to include some styling based on their value: expenses under $10 should have one style, those under $100 another, and those over $100 a third style. Which styles are chosen is up to you.
- For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expense list into two sections: one for personal expenses and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, particularly because it involves being careful about which items are removed.

# Day 46 – Challenge 1 and 2

- Change project 7 (iExpense) so that it uses NavigationLink for adding new expenses rather than a sheet. (Tip: The dismiss() code works great here, but you might want to add the navigationBarBackButtonHidden() modifier so they have to explicitly choose Cancel.)
- Try changing project 7 so that it lets users edit their issue name in the navigation title rather than a separate textfield. Which option do you prefer?
